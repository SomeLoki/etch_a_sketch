After initially misunderstanding and making the project probably harder than it needed to be (instead of boxes per side I took it as total boxes.. so some creative use of perfect squares was involved.) <br>

Project was to generate a grid of divs using DOM manipulation, and add event listeners to track which squares your mouse has passed over. <br>

The grid needed to be able to update after user input, and remove the old squares and create new ones. Further challenge was to randomize the color of the square when initially passed over, and then modify opacity on subsequential visits. <br>

Project mostly focused on skills tied to: <br>
- Function building <br>
- DOM manipulation :<br>
  - Creation of elements (including appending)<br>
  - Deletion of elements <br>
  - Use of DOM to either add classes for CSS to kick in, or to generate inline CSS <br>
- Event listeners <br>
- Arrays / loops <br>
